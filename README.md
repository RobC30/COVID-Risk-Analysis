The topic selected was Covid-19 as it is still shutting down large parts of the world. We created a predictive model by looking at different factors, such as vaccination status, testing, and comorbidities to determine the impact of COVID in communities. The purpose of the research is to see if there are any factors that could contribute to large outbreaks. A dataset on this [Github](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md) page was found and [this dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) will be used to conduct the analysis. The random forest machine learning model will be used to start the analysis.


While the data provided by Our World in Data is very comprehensive spanning many features across the continents we first need to clean up the data. We plan to do this by first sorting through and filtering out any misisng data points.
