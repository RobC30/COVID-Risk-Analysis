# COVID-Risk-Analysis Project
The topic we selected was Covid-19 as it is still shutting down large parts of the world and we wanted to see if there are any factors that could contribute to large outbreaks we found the dataset on this [Github](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md) page and the we are using [this dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) to do our analysis. We will be using a random forest machine learning model to start our analysis.
