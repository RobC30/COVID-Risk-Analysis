# COVID-Risk-Analysis Project
The topic selected was Covid-19 as it is still shutting down large parts of the world. The purpose of the research is to see if there are any factors that could contribute to large outbreaks. A dataset on this [Github](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md) page was found and [this dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) will be used to conduct the analysis. The random forest machine learning model will be used to start the analysis.
