# COVID-Risk-Analysis Project
The topic we selected was Covid-19 as it is still shutting down large parts of the world and we wanted to see if there are any factors that could contribute to large outbreaks we found the dataset on this [Github](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md) page and the we are using [this dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) to do our analysis. We will be using a random forest machine learning model to start our analysis.

# Transforming Data
While the data provided by Our World in Data is very comprehensive spanning many features across the continents we first need to clean up the data. We plan to do this by first sorting through and filtering out any misisng data points.
