# COVID-Risk-Analysis Project

The topic selected was COVID-19, since it is still shutting down large parts of the world. A predictive model was created by looking at a variety of factors, including vaccination status, testing, and comorbidities. The model was then used to determine the impact of COVID in communities. The purpose of the research is to see if there are any factors that could contribute to large outbreaks. A dataset on this [Github](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md) page was found and [this dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) will be used to conduct the analysis. The random forest machine learning model will be used to start the analysis.


The data provided by *Our World in Data* was very comprehensive, as it spanned many features across the globe. However, the data still needed to be cleaned up and was done so by first sorting through and filtering out any missing data points. Using Tableau, the data is easily visualized.
